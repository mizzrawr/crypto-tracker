## React module -  Final Project 

Hi y'all! This seems to be my final project (React Module) . 

I want to thank Brian Designs (Please check https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKsymTY_4BYR-wytLjex7A for more info). He is an amazing teacher (and a super cool guy!). 

This is my first time wroking with Next.js so I am still learning. 


This is a small crypto traker app, but enough words, go and just clone it :D
